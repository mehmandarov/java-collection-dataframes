* We built a ConferenceExplorer class for each library
* A ConferenceExplorer does the following:
** Reads in conferences and countries from two CSV files
** Filters the data for a specified year
** Provides methods that do the following:
*** Sort by days to event
*** Count by month
*** Count by country
*** Sum conference days by country
*** Group by country
*** Group by city
*** Get the unique countries with their flags for all conferences
*** Group by session types
*** Count by session type
** Output each of the above to a CSV file (TBD)
